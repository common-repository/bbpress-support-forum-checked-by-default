You also have the option to disallow the unchecking of the checkbox, so that all topics on the forums you specify are flagged as support topics.

Can I also remove the text "This is a support topic" on support forums?  

* No, the author of the original plugin did not wrap this in an ID or class which would allow us to hide the text also.
